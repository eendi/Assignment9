# Find the address using string methods
# Address starts from the first '(' and ends before ', Tel.'

# Find the position of the first '('

# Find the position of ', Tel.' after the start index
end_index = text.find(', Tel.', start_index)

# Extract the address substring
address = text[start_index + 1:end_index]

# Print the address
